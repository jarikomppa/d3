$Q testroom
test room, let's check some randoms
$P c=0
$P rnd:100 c+=1
Should happen always
$P rnd:90 c+1
Should happen almost always
$P rnd:50 c+1
Should happen half of the time
$P rnd:10 c+1
Should happen rarely
$P rnd:0 c+1
Shouldn't happen
$P
Random events counted: <<c>>

$P HAS:unused
Shouldn't print anything <<c>> even though we have that para-paragraph for printing. 
This may be tricky to fix.<<c>>
<<c>>

$Q gotoroom
page with goto
$P GOTO:testroom HAS:unused
Predicated goto should fail, but predication means this isn't shown either
$P GOTO:testroom
This paragraph shouldn't be seen, because we leave this page before it
$P
This should never be reached either
