# DialogTree TODO

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things still to be done:

- Documentation
    - Better tutorial than what MuCho had
	- Engine integrations
- Python engine
    - Separate state from the d3 class in Python so same state can be shared between decks
    - Cleanup?
- JavaScript engine
- Pure C engine
    - Largely done
- C++ engine
- Compiler
    - Path to localization
    - Path to voiceover
    - $R copy just the answers from a page
	- Still some issues with whitespace handling (should we eat newlines and where, etc)
- Multi-deck example
- Figure out what to do with multi-paragraph answers and opcodes
