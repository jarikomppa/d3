# DialogTree TODO

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things still to be done:

- Documentation
    - Starting off from MuCho docs
    - Better tutorial than what MuCho had
    - Overview of all opcodes at a glance
- Python engine
    - Separate state from the d3 class in Python so same state can be shared between decks
    - Cleanup?
- JavaScript engine
- Pure C engine
- C++ engine
- Compiler
    - Path to localization
    - Compiler output .dot files
- Multi-deck example
