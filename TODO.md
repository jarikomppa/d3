# DialogTree TODO

Here's a non-exhaustive list of things still to be done:

- Documentation
 - Better tutorial than what MuCho had
 - Overview of all opcodes at a glance
- JavaScript engine
- Pure C engine
- C++ engine
- $I include other file tag
- $C config tag for current deck prefix and possibly other options
- Separate state from the d3 class in Python so same state can be shared between decks
- Path to localization
- Compiler output .dot files
