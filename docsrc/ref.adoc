## Reference

Here's all of the syntax in handy table form. In many cases there are several ways to do the same thing so you can pick your favorite syntax. All of the variants compile to the same thing.

### Line Types

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|Line start    | Description
|$C            | Deck configuration. Use to set deck prefix and optional flags.
|$Q            | Start of a new card. Can include opcodes (commands and predicates)
|$A            | Answer block. Can include opcodes (commands and predicates)
|$P            | Paragraph. May contain opcodes (commands and predicates)
|$O            | Optional. Same as $P but without paragraph break.
|$I            | Include another file into the script
|$G            | Global page. Works like $Q, gosub'd at start of every $Q

### Tag types

[cols="20,~"]
|===
|tag           | Description
|<deck>        | Deck configuration. Use to set deck prefix and optional flags.
|<card>        | Start of a new card. Can include opcodes (commands and predicates)
|<a>           | Answer block. Can include opcodes (commands and predicates)
|<p>           | Paragraph. May contain opcodes (commands and predicates)
|<o>           | Optional. Same as <p> but without paragraph break.
|<include>     | Include another file into the script
|<global>      | Global page. Works like <card>, gosub'd at start of every <card>

### Predicates

Predicates control whether the rest of the commands are executed, as well as control whether an answer is shown to the user.
