# Introduction

DialogTree is a engine for building dialogue trees with non-player characters in games. The way it works, it can also be used as basis
for multiple choise adventures, visual novels and the like. Just be careful not to use the trademarked terms enforced by ChooseCo.

The d3 concept consists of several pieces. Each dialogue itself is called a "deck", where each scene is a "card" which contains a "question" 
field and zero or more "answer" fields. Each answer then tells which card should be read next.

....
blockdiag {
   orientation = portrait
   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7;
   5 -> 8 -> 9;
   4 -> 10 -> 11 -> 16;
   4 -> 12 -> 13 -> 16;
   4 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16;
   3 -> 3;
   8 -> 2;
}
....

Think of each box as a page in a book, and at the bottom of each page you'll find something in the lines of, "Turn to page 32 if you want to..".

These "decks" are written in DialogTree story definition language. Large portion of this document covers this process. For most uses,
the format is trivial, but DialogTree offers functionality to make very complicated dialogues.

The "deck" files are compiled to usable form with the d3 compiler. The resulting files are read by the d3 engine which can be integrated
to your actual game engine, along with some form of persistent state.

## Concepts

Here's some of the terms used by DialogTree.
