# Engine Integration

The DialogTree engine has been implemented in several programming languages, but the basic idea for all is the same; to make using the 
dialogs as simple as possible. The interfaces follow this pattern:

- Allocate and connect to persistent state
- Load / Use data
- Get question text
- Get number of answers
- Get answer text
- Choose answer
- Cleanup
